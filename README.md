# Spotify Clone

A simple Spotify Clone built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This project allows users to play songs, pause, navigate through the playlist, adjust volume, and seek within a track.

## Folder Structure

spotify-clone/ │-- index.html # Main UI 
│-- style.css # Styling file

│-- script.js # JavaScript logic

## How It Works

- The app fetches songs dynamically from the `/songs/` folder.
- Clicking on a song plays it instantly.
- Seekbar updates as the song progresses.
- Volume can be adjusted using the slider.
- Users can navigate between previous & next songs.
